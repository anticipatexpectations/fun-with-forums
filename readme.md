#unsolved problems
-post edit and delete works but individual comment edit and delete do not. non required extra feature but unattempted due to deadlined

-drop down menu to choose how to sort posts or comments based on chronology, number of comments, or likes. non required extra feature but unattempted due to deadline

-ran out of time to do a decent job on css, focused on feature requirements and some extras like edit and delete
